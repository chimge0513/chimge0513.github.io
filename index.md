# **Welcome to My Portfolio**




### **About Me**

My name is Chimge Tsendnyam. I was born in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and moved to the U.S. when I was 15. I currently work as an IT Procurement Operations Specialist at Discover Financial Services. I live with my husband, dog and turtle in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. In my free time, I like cooking, going to the gym, listening to podcasts, reading books and working on projects. 
Ever since I was a kid, I loved math, statistics and computer science courses. I wish I had taken more of them. I went to a small liberal arts college, Illinois College for my undergraduate and studied Economics, Finance and International Studies. In senior year of my college, I went to study abroad in Geneva Switzerland to study Swiss banking system and their corporate social responsibilities. When I entered the corporate world as a budget analyst, I realized how much I loved working with large and complex data. 

In 2019, I decided to do my M.S. in Data Science with Bellevue University. Every single course left me hungry to learn more and inspired me to work on variety of data science projects. As I’m on this journey to become a data scientist, I’m excited to share some of my work with you.
